# OTel Service Documentation

## 📊 Service Overview

- **Service Name**: otel
- **Category**: Observability / Telemetry
- **Status**: Planned/Incomplete (Minimal configuration found)
- **IP Address**: Not configured
- **External URL**: Not configured

## 🚀 Description

The OTel service directory appears to be a secondary or alternative OpenTelemetry setup. It contains only an empty otel-collector subdirectory, suggesting this was either a planned deployment that wasn't completed, or a legacy/alternative configuration to the main opentelemetry-home stack.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Docker Compose Location
```
/nfs/dockermaster/docker/otel/
```

### Current State
- **Status**: Mostly empty directory structure
- **Configuration files**: None found
- **Docker compose**: Not present
- **Collector directory**: Empty subdirectory exists

### Directory Structure
```
otel/
└── otel-collector/    # Empty directory
```

### Relationship to opentelemetry-home
- **Duplicate service**: Similar purpose to opentelemetry-home
- **Status**: opentelemetry-home appears to be the active deployment
- **Possible use**: Could be for testing or alternative configuration

## 🔐 Security

### Current Security Status
- **No configuration**: No security settings present
- **Future considerations**: Would require same security as opentelemetry-home

## 📈 Monitoring

### Health Checks
- **Current**: None configured
- **Future**: Would require OpenTelemetry Collector health checks

### Metrics
- **Current**: Not applicable
- **Future**: Would provide telemetry collection capabilities

## 🔄 Backup Strategy

### Data Backup
- **Current**: No data to backup
- **Future**: Would require configuration backup

### Configuration Backup
- **Current**: Empty directory structure only
- **Future**: Docker compose and collector configuration files

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Current Status
1. **Issue**: Service not configured
   - **Symptoms**: Empty directory with only subdirectory structure
   - **Solution**: Either implement configuration or remove unused directory

### Recommendations
1. **Evaluate need**: Determine if this is needed alongside opentelemetry-home
2. **Clean up**: Consider removing if not needed
3. **Implement**: If needed, create proper configuration

## 📝 Maintenance

### Implementation Options
If this service is to be implemented:
1. Create docker-compose.yml file
2. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector
3. Set up proper networking
4. Coordinate with existing opentelemetry-home stack

### Dependencies
- **Potential conflict**: With existing opentelemetry-home service
- **Future requirements**: Similar to opentelemetry-home stack

### Decision Required
- **Keep or remove**: Determine if this duplicate service is needed
- **Merge possibility**: Consider consolidating with opentelemetry-home
- **Alternative use**: Could be for different environments or testing
