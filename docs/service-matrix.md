## 🚨 Critical Issues Summary

### Immediate Action Required

1. **Prometheus Service** - 🔴 **NOT DEPLOYED**
   - Impact: No monitoring for infrastructure
   - Action: Deploy Prometheus service immediately
   - Dependency: Check for existing config

2. **Vault Service** - 🔴 **UNHEALTHY**
   - Impact: Secrets management unavailable
   - Action: Initialize and unseal Vault
   - Dependency: Requires administrator intervention

3. **Keycloak Service** - 🔴 **AUTH FAILING**
   - Impact: Authentication services down
   - Action: Check database connectivity
   - Dependency: PostgreSQL connection

### Documentation Gaps

- **Completed**: All High Priority (4/4), Medium Priority (1/1), and Low Priority (10/10) services
- **Remaining**: Special cases (5) and some Infrastructure services (4)
- **Special cases** need individual assessment
